# Integration Tools

Integration Tools is a section of Workshop (Welkin's codeless configuration tool), which allows you to configure Apps and other integrations. You can configure which systems have access to data within Welkin and how they access it.

# Overview

Integration Tools allows developers and program directors to manage their integrations with Welkin without contacting a member of the Welkin professional services team. This is a self serve tool for managing how data flows out of Welkin via Welkin's APIs.

Integration Tools is broken into 3 main sections. Credentials for setting up access credentials. Webhooks for getting notifcations about changes to data in Welkin. Environments for selecting which Welkin instance/environment you want to configure integrations for.

# Credentials

Credentials issued via Integration Tools grants Apps and Integrations access to all the data in the Welkin environment. These `client_id` and `client_secret` pair generated by Integration Tools is for syncing data for your entire Welkin environment and is not scoped to specific patients or workers within your Environment.

Each App or Integration you configure for your Welkin Environment should have its own set of credentials for accessing data. Granting separate credentials for each system which has access to Welkin data ensures that if you want to disable a single system you can do this without effecting others.

Credentials created in Integration Tools are active as soon as they are created and can be used to generate access tokens. Access tokens are short lived and are used to make calls to the API. Details on this token exchange process is [documented here](/data_api.html/#authentication).

<aside>When you invalidate Credentials in Integration Tools, Access Tokens are NOT invalidated. They will expire as normal. The credentials will no longer be valid for generating new Access Tokens.</aside>

# Webhooks



# Environments verse Configurations




# Limitations

## One webhook per environment

Currently you can only configure one webhook per environment. This limits how many services can receive data from Welkin via webhook.

# Credential procedures

In the event that you believe one of your access Credentials has been compromised the following procedure should be followed to rotate your Credentials.

A credential could be compromised in the following ways including but not limited to:
* a outside entity gaining access to your credential storage system
* a credential is shared via an insecure channel
* an employee past or present had access to a credential that they should not have

To rotate credentials follow these steps:
1. On the Credentials page generate a new Credential (client secret) for the effected Client.
2) Begin using this new Credential for sending requests to Welkin
3) Add this new Credential to the set of possible keys that are valid for verifying the signature on our Webhook notifications
4) On the Credentials page invalidate your old credentials thus ceasing access to Welkin data for the old Credential
5) On the Webhooks page update the keys used for signing our Webhook notifications
6) Remove the old credentials from validating the signature of the Webhooks
7) Rotation process is complete
