# Overview

Welkin’s goal is to empower you, our customers, to deliver patient-centered care. Our APIs exists in support of this goal. Whether it’s data kept within our platform, or your pre-existing systems, we think you should have complete, real-time access and agency over your own data.

Using Welkin's APIs will allow you to keep your systems in sync with Welkin and extend Welkin's functionality with Apps.

# API updates
**Welkin's API is in active development.** We will be making backwards compatible changes over the coming months with little or no advanced notice. You should expect that we will add additional optional fields to resource schemas and new resource types to the API. Your integration should be built with this understanding and should not break with the addition of new fields or resource types. Use of strict schema validation is not recommended. Breaking changes will be communicated in advance of rollout and we will work with you to make the transition. [See API Versioning and Update Policy](/version_policy.html)
